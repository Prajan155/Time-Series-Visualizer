Great idea! A Table of Contents (ToC) should give readers a quick roadmap of what they’ll find in the README. Here’s an updated version with short explanations for each section:

# Time-Series-Visualizer

A Python project for exploring and visualizing time series data. It leverages **pandas** for data manipulation, cleaning, and resampling, while creating insightful static plots with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**, and interactive visualizations with **Plotly**.
